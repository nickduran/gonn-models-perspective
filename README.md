=======================

GONN (good ole neural network models) for topiCS paper on perspective-taking (Nick Duran, Rick Dale, and Alexia Galati). Code written for Matlab.

NR.m, runNR.m: contains code to run the normalized recurrence network simulations (see Figures 2 and 3 in manuscript)

makeStimuli.m, runActivationTrack.m, runMLP.m, slidefun.m, test_perceptron_from.m, train_perceptron_fresh.m, and train_perceptron_from.m: contains the code to run multilayer perceptron simulations (see Figures 4 and 5 in manuscript)
